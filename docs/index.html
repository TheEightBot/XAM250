        <h2>Patterns for Cross Platform Mobile Development - XAM250</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to access platform-specific APIs that are not intrinsically available from your shared code. For example, you might want to take a picture, perform file I/O, or play audio. The recommended approach is to code an abstraction layer that will let you invoke the platform-specific API from shared code. This course shows you three techniques for doing this: Factory pattern, Service Locator pattern, and Dependency Injection.</p>
<h3>Upon completion you will be able to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Locate dependencies using the Factory Pattern</li>
<li>Use a Service Locator to register and retrieve dependencies</li>
<li>Use an IoC container to automatically inject dependencies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="parts/part1.html">Exercise 1: Use the Factory Pattern to access a dependency from shared code (XAM250)</a>
<br>
<p>This exercise will take an existing iOS, Android, or Windows project and pull out sharable code into a Portable Class Library (PCL), using the <a href="http://www.oodesign.com/factory-pattern.html" target="_blank">Factory Pattern</a> to isolate the platform-specific code to read and write the storage file used to display quotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part2.html">Exercise 2: Add an abstraction and Service Locator into our project to find and use a platform-specific feature. (XAM250)</a>
<br>
<p>This exercise will define a service for performing text-to-speech and then create a <strong>Service Locator</strong> to find the implementation of that service which is platform-specific. This is intended to be done as part of the online class, if you are working through this on your own you can follow the step-by-step instructions shown below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part3.html">Exercise 3: Switch to a DI/IoC container and inject our dependency into our code. (XAM250)</a>
<br>
<p>This final exercise will replace the <strong>Factory pattern</strong> used in the first exercise with a <strong>Dependency Injection (DI) container</strong> that will supply the quote loader as part of the constructor. You'll then optionally, remove the <strong>Service Locator</strong> as well and just use the DI/IoC container injection approach.</p>
</li>
</ol>
